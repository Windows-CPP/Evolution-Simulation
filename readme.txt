This file shows how to use, and understand this simulation. Note: This program has variables that need to be changed.
I hope to introduce .simplegui at one point to make graphs and imaging for the simulation. See roadmap.

I - How to use the program



II - The math behind the program
This is going to be hard to explain. There are several variables, checks, and equations that are required to simulate a population. We have to take into account Mutations, Enviroment, Organism Type, and much more. This will take a long time, maybe over three months. I'm going to have to work on the math when I get there.



III - A quick review of evolution
I'm putting this here as a reference, so the terms above aren't confusing.

Evolution - The adaptation of a species population to the enviroment.
Mutation - The random change in an organisms genes and DNA. May or may not happen.
DNA - Deoxyrhibonucleic Acid. It makes up our chromosomes, pretty much our structure.
